# Simple interview test:

This project is a small test to be solved by candidates during the interviews for java developers.

## Duration
This interview step is intended to last from 20 to 40 minutes in total, some candidates could take a little longer, is strongly suggested to stablish a time limit from the beggining.

Have in mind that you must add an extra 30 to 40 minutes to the total interview time given the "questions and answers" round and the time spent on background checking.

A total of 60 to 90 minutes shall be reserved for the whole interview.

## Requirements
This shall be solved by doing screen-sharing, therefore the candidate shall have the following requirements installed on his machine:

* A screen sharing solution (Skype, hangouts, GTM)
* JAVA 1.8
* A java IDE (Eclipse, Intelli-j, Netbeans...)
    * Make sure your IDE has a Maven plugin installed.
    * Gradle plugin is also strongly suggested since it may be needed.


## General description
This screening has 3 major secions, the last one being optional depending on the desired stack and the available time.

1. Fix simple bugs on a small application.

	* Familiarity with Java 8 or the ability to investigate about it.
	* Basic hierarchy knowledge.
	* Requirements comprenhention.

2. Solve a simple algorithms question
	
	* Exception handling.
	* Requirements comprenhention.
	* Reaction capacity.
	* Basic language knowledge.
	* Basic JUNIT concepts.

3. [Optional depending on the time/stack] Expose the algorithm with a rest endpoint

	* Basic Spring concepts
	* Basic REST concepts

The candidate can use/access internet resources at any time (since you will be able to do it in a regular working environment), however he should not look for the specific answer for the propossed problem (i.e. Google.com * palindrome in java)
